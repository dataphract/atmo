# Atmo

A library for interacting with the [AT Protocol] in Rust.

## Overview

Atmo provides high-level clients for [XRPC] and [Jetstream] via the `atmo` and `atmo_jetstream`
crates. These crates use the bindings provided by `atmo_api`, which are parsed from the
[ATproto Lexicons] using `atmo_lexicon` and generated by `atmo_codegen`. All these crates depend
on `atmo_core`, which implements the core of the ATproto data model.
