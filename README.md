# atmo

a Rust library for the [AT Protocol]

## status

**This is a work in progress.**

At present, there are five crates:

- `atmo_core` contains the core API types (AT-URI, CID, DID, etc).
- `atmo_lexicon` contains the Lexicon schema parser.
- `atmo_codegen` contains the bindings generator.
- `atmo_api` contains the bindings generated by `atmo_codegen`.
- `atmo` provides the high-level client interface, and re-exports `atmo_api` and `atmo_core`.

## usage

To update the bindings in `atmo_api`, run

``` sh
cargo run -p atmo_codegen --bin gen -- <DIR> | rustfmt > atmo_api/src/generated.rs
```

...where `<DIR>` is the root of the Lexicon schema tree. The code generator is being tested against
the [atproto Lexicons], but it should handle custom Lexicons as well.
