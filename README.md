# atmo

a Rust library for the [AT Protocol]

## status

**This is a work in progress.**

At present, there are four crates:

- `atmo` contains the core API types (AT-URI, CID, DID, etc).
- `atmo_api` contains the bindings generated by `atmo_codegen`.
- `atmo_codegen` contains the bindings generator.
- `atmo_lexicon` contains the Lexicon schema parser.

More will follow. Stay tuned!

## usage

To generate bindings (which are incomplete, at time of writing) for a set of Lexicon schemae, run

``` sh
cargo run --release -p atmo_codegen --bin gen -- <DIR> | rustfmt > bindings.rs
```

...where `<DIR>` is the root of the schema tree. The code generator is being tested against the
[atproto Lexicons]; I can't guarantee that it'll work against anything else.
